**CAUTION: This installation script will partition your drives deleting anything on them**<br  />
**CAUTION: I have only tested these scripts on my own machine. I do not know if they will work with yours**<br  />
**Also I Use Arch BTW**<br  />

To use: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoryTibbettsDev/IUseArchBTW/master/IUseArchBTW > IUseArchBTW<br  />
bash IUseArchBTW<br  />
**REMEMBER TO SET PASSWORD or you will not be able to get in**<br  />

On first boot: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoryTibbettsDev/IUseArchBTW/master/desktop.sh > desktop.sh<br  />
bash desktop.sh<br  />
This will install the rest of the packages and all the dotfiles<br  />

If you want a slightly more minimal install for a virtual machine use vm.sh instead. vm.sh includes some development packages aswell<br  />
